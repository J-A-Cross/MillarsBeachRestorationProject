            <p className="mx-7 py-2 pr-2">The vision started with Lindsay and Joy Lord purchasing the 100Ha peninsula in the early 1970's.   They have now passed on their love of this wild and beautiful place to their children and grandchildren.  </p>
                <p className="mx-7 py-2 pr-2">The Lord Family Trust is now seeking to restore it to be place where native birdlife, flora and fauna thrive for their great-grandchildren and visitors to experience;  birds like our resident Kiwi  population and our Tui, Korora, Kaka and Kakariki.</p>
                <p className="mx-7 py-2 pr-2"> Early October 2023 we initiated Phase 1 of 3 on the eastern-most third of the peninsula  - monitoring, trapping and baiting.  This includes a core defense-line of Automatic Traps that continue to operate.  We are currently expanding into Phase 2 over the next western 1/3 of the peninsula.</p>
